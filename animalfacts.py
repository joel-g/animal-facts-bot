    'Adult wolves have large feet. A fully grown wolf would have a paw print nearly 13 centimeters long and 10 centimeters wide.',
    'Wolves live and hunt in groups called a pack. A pack can range from two wolves to as many as 20 wolves depending on such factors as habitat and food supply. Most packs have one breeding pair of wolves, called the alpha pair, who lead the hunt.',

    'Wolves in the Arctic have to travel much longer distances than wolves in the forest to find food and will sometimes go for several days without eating.',
    'When hunting alone, the wolf catches small animals such as squirrels, hares, chipmunks, raccoons or rabbits. However, a pack of wolves can hunt very large animals like moose, caribou and yaks.',
    'When the pack kills an animal, the alpha pair always eats first. As food supply is often irregular for wolves, they will eat up to 1/5th of their own body weight at a time to make up for days of missed food.',
    'Wolves have two layers of fur, an undercoat and a top coat, which allow them to survive in temperatures as low at minus 40 degrees fahrenheit! In warmer weather they flatten their fur to keep cool.',
    'A wolf can run at a speed of 40 miles per hour during a chase. Wolves have long legs and spend most of their time trotting at a speed of 7-10 miles per hour. They can keep up a reasonable pace for hours and have been known to cover distances of 55 miles in one night.',
