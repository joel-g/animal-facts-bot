

## How to contribute (Teach AnimalFactsBot a new animal):
        Choose an animal listed in the issues or any other real animal.

* Fork/clone the repo
* Add a tuple of strings of facts (to animalfacts.py) pertaining to a particular animal. Name the tuple variable following the format 'NAMEOFANIMAL_FACTS'. Put the tuple in alphabetical order with the other tuples.
* Add your tuple to the ALL_FACTS tuple.
* Add a line to the check_comment_for_animal() function for your animal following the format.
* Add your animal to the Readme
* Add me on Twitter @joelatwar

Please:
* Don't add a very small set of facts (this will cause the bot to be repetetive regarding your animal).
* Each fact must make sense independent of the other facts in the tuple because users will only get one fact at a time.
* Only add TRUE facts. Please no trolling with 'alternative facts'.
* Don't add 'seal', 'bat' or 'duck' facts unless you've figured out how to not reply to homonyms.
* Don't add 'cat' or 'dog' because they are just too common on reddit.

If you have a question the quickest way to reach is me on twitter @joelatwar
